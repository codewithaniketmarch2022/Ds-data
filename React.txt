-React has the same events as HTML: click, change, mouseover etc.


1) Differentiate between Real DOM and Virtual DOM.
               
   Real DOM	                                Virtual  DOM
1. It updates slow.	                     1. It updates faster.
2. Can directly update HTML.	             2. Can’t directly update HTML.
3. Creates a new DOM if element updates.     3. Updates the JSX if element updates.
4. DOM manipulation is very expensive.	     4. DOM manipulation is very easy.
5. Too much of memory wastage.	             5. No memory wastage.



2) List some of the major advantages of React.
-It increases the application’s performance
-It can be conveniently used on the client as well as server side
-Because of JSX, code’s readability increases
-React is easy to integrate with other frameworks like Meteor, Angular, etc
-Using React, writing UI test cases become extremely easy.



3) What are the limitations of React?
-React is just a library, not a full-blown framework
-Its library is very large and takes time to understand
-It can be little difficult for the novice programmers to understand
-Coding gets complex as it uses inline templating and JSX.



4) What is JSX ?
-JSX stands for JavaScript XML,JSX allows us to write HTML in React.
-JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.



5) what is component in react ?
-Components are the building blocks of a React application’s UI.
-These components split up the entire UI into small independent and reusable pieces. 
-Then it renders each of these components independent of each other without affecting the rest  of the UI.
-React components can be reusable,So in huge project there is no need to write an repeat code.
-Types of components 

    -Class component - render() is present.
    -Function component - render() is not present.



6) What is the purpose of render() in React ?
-Each React component must have a render() mandatorily.
-It returns a single React element which is the representation of the native DOM component.
-If more than one HTML element needs to be rendered, then they must be grouped together    inside one enclosing tag such as <form>, <group>,<div> etc.



7)What is Props?
-Props means properties.
-It passing the arguments inside the react components.
--They are immutable.



8) What is a state in React and how is it used?
-States are the heart of React components. States are the source of data and must be kept as  simple as possible.
-Basically, states are the objects which determine components rendering and behavior.
-They are mutable.
-They are accessed this.state()




9) Diff between state and props ?
 
SN	     Props	                                                State

1.	Props are read-only.	                      State changes can be asynchronous.
2.	Props are immutable.	                      State is mutable.
3.      Props can be accessed by the                  State cannot be accessed by child components.
        child component.
4.      The stateless component can have Props.       The stateless components cannot have State.
5.      Props make components reusable.               State cannot make components reusable.



10) What is arrow function in React? How is it used ?
-Arrow functions are more of brief syntax for writing the function expression. They are also  called ‘fat arrow‘ (=>) the functions.
-With arrow functions, the this keyword always represents the object that defined the arrow  function.

e.g
   // using arrow functions
      let x = (x, y) => x * y;




11) What are the different phases of React component’s lifecycle ?

There are three different phases of React component’s lifecycle:

-Initial Rendering Phase: This is the phase when the component is about to start its life  journey and make its way to the DOM.

-Updating Phase: Once the component gets added to the DOM, it can potentially update and re- render only when a prop or state change occurs. That happens only in this phase.

-Unmounting Phase: This is the final phase of a component’s life cycle in which the component  is destroyed and removed from the DOM.




12) What is an event in React ?
-In React, events are the triggered reactions to specific actions like mouse hover, mouse  click, key press, etc.
e.g 
   <div onClick={this.show}>Click Me!</div>



13) what is refs in react ?
-Refs are a function used for to access the DOM element and the React element that you might have created on your own.



14) How to create a form in React ?
-In React, form data is usually handled by the components.
-When the data is handled by the components, all the data is stored in the component state. - You can control changes by adding event handlers in the onChange attribute and that event   handler will be used to update the state of the variable.



15) What is flux ?
-Flux is a pattern for managing how data flows through a React application.



16) What is redux ?
-Redux is an open-source JavaScript library used to manage application state. React uses Redux  for building the user interface.



17) What is react router ?
-React Router is a powerful routing library built on top of React, which helps in adding new  screens  and flows to the application.
-This keeps the URL in sync with data that’s being displayed on the web page. 
-It maintains a standardized structure and behavior and is used for developing single page web   applications. 
-React Router has a simple API.




18) Difference between ES5 and ES6 ?      
 

                ES5	                                       ES6

      ECMA script 5,                                     - ECMA script 6
     -It was introduced in 2009.	                 - It was introduced in 2015.

   -It supports primitive data types that                - In ES6, there are some additions to
    are string, number, boolean, null, and                 JavaScript data types.
    undefined.                                           
  
    -There are only one way to define the                - There are two new ways to define variables 
     variables by using the var keyword.                   that are let and const.

    -It has a lower performance as compared              - It has a higher performance than ES5.
     to ES6.

    -Object manipulation is time-consuming in ES5.       - Object manipulation is less 
                                                           time-consuming in ES6.

    -It provides a larger range of community             - It provides a less range of community
     supports than that of ES6.                            supports than that of ES5.





19) what is HOC ?
-A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic.
-It is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. 




20) What are Styled Components ?
-Styled-Components is a library for React. 
- It is the successor of CSS Modules. 

The styled-components provides:

  - Automatic critical CSS.
  - No class name bugs.
  - Easier deletion of CSS.
  - Simple dynamic styling.
  - Painless maintenance.
